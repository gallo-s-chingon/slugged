# Slugged

A revised version of [benlinton/slugify](https://github.com/benlinton/slugify) to convert filenames into a clean, lowercase, alphanumeric slug format with single delimiters (hyphens or underscores), stripping out emojis, non-ASCII characters, and punctuation while preserving file extensions.

---

## Why Slugged?

Iâ€™m mostly a prose writer, but nerdy enough to tinker with tools, LLMs, and distro-hopping to kill time. Years ago (sometime after 2014), I stumbled upon [benlinton/slugify](https://github.com/benlinton/slugify). It was a lifesaver for turning blog titles into filenames for my static siteâ€”cut, paste, slugify, done. But there was a catch: it didnâ€™t handle emojis, non-ASCII characters, or punctuation. Iâ€™d roll with it until a deploy failed, then realize some funky character in the title broke everything. Back to the drawing boardâ€”manually renaming files or using Name Mangler on macOS to clean up the mess.

Like any *nix user, Iâ€™d spend months tweaking scripts to save 46 seconds later. I started with a function wrapping `slugify`, added a script to scrub the rest (thanks, Stack Overflow!), refined it with ChatGPT and Perplexity, and then Grok (from xAI) helped me slap it all together, push it to GitHub, and even get it into Homebrew. Now, `slugged` is my one-stop shop for filename slugification, and I figuredâ€”why not share it?

**TL;DR**: Started with `slugify` + Name Mangler, built a function and script, got LLM help to refine it, and now itâ€™s a Homebrew-installable tool for everyone.

## Features

- Converts filenames to lowercase alphanumeric (0-9, a-z) strings.
- Replaces non-ASCII, punctuation, and emojis with a single delimiter (default: `-`).
- Supports underscores (`-u`) as an alternative delimiter.
- Preserves file extensions.
- Options for verbose output (`-v`), dry run (`-n`), and help (`-h`).

## Installation

### Via Homebrew (Recommended)

```bash
brew tap gallo-s-chingon/slugged
brew install slugged# Rename with hyphens (default)
```
## Manual Installation
Download and make executable

```bash
curl -L https://github.com/gallo-s-chingon/slugged/raw/main/slugged.sh -o slugged
chmod +x slugged
mv slugged /usr/local/bin/  # Or another directory in your $PATH
```

## Usage
```bash
slugged [options] <file> â€¦
```
run `slugged -h` for a full list of options

## Examples
```bash
slugged -v "test --    _ __ --_- file    name ðŸ˜‚.txt"
# Output: renamed 'test --    _ __ --_- file    name ðŸ˜‚.txt' -> 'test-file-name.txt'

# Rename with underscores
slugged -u "test --    _ __ --_- file    name ðŸ˜‚.txt"
# Output: renamed 'test --    _ __ --_- file    name ðŸ˜‚.txt' -> 'test_file_name.txt'

# Dry run (no changes)
slugged -n "My File! ðŸ˜Š.docx"
# Output: rename: My File! ðŸ˜Š.docx -> my-file.docx
```

## Options

- `-h`: Show help
- `-v`: Verbose mode (show rename actions)
- `-n`: Dry run (no changes, implies `-v`)
- `-u`: Use underscores instead of hyphens as a delimiter
